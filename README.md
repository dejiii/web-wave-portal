### WEB WAVW PORTAL 👋🏽

*This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.*

### Features
1. We’re going to write a smart contract. That contract has all the logic around how the 👋 s are handled. This is like your server code.
 
2. The smart contract will be deployed to the blockchain. This way, anyone in the world will be able to access and run our smart contract (if we give them permission to do so). So, pretty much like a server :).
 
3. Building client website that will let people easily interact with our smart contract on the blockchain.
I’ll explain certain things in-depth as needed (ex. how mining working, how smart contracts are compiled and ran, etc) but for now lets just focus on getting stuff running.
